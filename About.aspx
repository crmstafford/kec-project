            <b>Organizational History</b>
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        <span class="greycontent">
            It is 2010, a nine year old boy named Max Guinn is home sick from school asking his Mom if he can watch PG-13 movies and have a cell phone. He argues
            he is almost ten years old and very responsible.  His Mom agrees turning ten is a big deal and asks, "Now that you are turning ten, what will you do
            to be of service?"<br /><br />
            After thinking about it, Max decides he will teach his third grade class about protecting the planet. He has absolutely no idea where to start or
            what to do next. So he Googles movies on the environment and spends the next day watching Food, Inc.  and The Cove.  The films break his heart.
            Max is deeply disturbed by the condition of thousands of animals in factory farms and the slaughter of more than 20,000 dolphins and porpoises off
            the coast of Japan every year, and how their meat, containing toxic levels of mercury, is sold as food to school children in Japan.  In his continued
            internet search, he learns more and more about pollution, pesticides, habitat destruction, water concerns and things that overwhelm him.<br /><br />
            At a loss, he returns to his Mom and announces, "One person can't make a difference." Max, like many young people, feels the problems are too big
            for any one person to have an impact.  As a result, Max and his Mom formed KidsEcoClub to empower youth to fuel social change and take transformative
            action to support healthy people, healthy communities and a healthy planet. <br /><br />
            In a recent speech, Max quoted the great basketball coach John Wooden who said, "It's not so important who starts the game but who finishes it."
            Max said, "Starting KidsEcoClub isn't so impressive. KidsEcoClub depends on each of you getting into the game.  Together, we are capable of great
            things!"<br /><br />
            Along the way, Max learned one person can make a difference. Each of us can make a difference.  Together, all things are possible.

            KEC is a 501c(3) organization with broad vision. Imagine an educational system that enables students to engage in school environmental clubs,
            receive free holistic preventive medical care, participate in nutrition, cooking and wellness classes and learn about sustainability practices
            and technology, which are all designed to support healthy people, healthy communities and a healthy planet. Envision schools that foster
            sustainability awareness, are connected by secure social media, knowledge, and the desire to develop and maintain initiatives that will help
            to ensure our collective future. Environmental, health and sustainability concerns are rising and the education system is in dire need of support
            and additional resources to help create a future generation that is equipped with the content knowledge and the skills to lead efforts to sustain
            the planet and its people. 
            <br /><br />
            Join the movement! Start a school club, volunteer, take action, form a collaboration, contribute!

            For example, the Center for Marine
            Biodiversity and Conservation (CMBC) is a center of interdisciplinary cooperation in research, collaborating with partners and scientists from
            other academic institutions, government agencies, industry leaders, and conservation organizations around the world, to seek technically
            sophisticated, regionally appropriate strategies to prevent and reverse biodiversity collapse. Bastyr University is an accredited, globally
            respected institution of natural health arts and sciences, improving the planet through innovative education, research and clinical service.
            Natural Doctors International (NDI) promotes responsible volunteerism and holistic health services. The National Aquarium is a nonprofit aquatic
            education and conservation organization with the mission to inspire conservation of the world’s aquatic treasures. The Smithsonian Ocean Portal
            supports the Smithsonian’s mission to increase the public’s understanding and stewardship of the Ocean. The Hydrologic Research Center was established
            to bridge the large gap existing between scientific research in hydrology and applications for the solution of important societal problems that
            involve water.
