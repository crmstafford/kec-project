            <b>Susan Guinn - President and Co-founder</b><br />
            Susan Guinn received her Baccalaureate Degree in Nursing from the University of New Mexico in 1988 and graduated from the University Of Denver School Of Law
            with her J.D in 1991. She has a San Diego based national law practice emphasizing consumer protection, including product liability, business litigation,
            birth injury medical malpractice, severe personal injury, environmental law and insurance bad faith.  She was a two time President for the Western Trial Lawyers
            and is or has been in the past a member of the Consumer Attorneys of California (“CAOC”), the San Diego Trial Lawyers Association, the Western Trial Lawyers
            Association, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, the Attorneys Information Exchange Group, and Trial Lawyers for Public Justice.  In addition, she has
            served as a Board Member for CAOC from approximately 1996 through 2000.<br /><br />
            In addition to founding KidsEcoClub in 2010, Ms Guinn is also a founding board member and Secretary for the non-profit organization the St. Paul’s Foundation for
            International Reconciliation, which provides legal and financial support to the St Paul's Center in Kampala Uganda.  The Center is led by Bishop Christopher Senyonyo
            who was recognized as one of the top ten religious leaders in the world by the Huffington Post.  It provides women’s self-help and advocacy programs, HIV education
            and prevention, literacy training, and micro loan programs to underserved populations in Uganda and elsewhere.

            <b>Max G.- Co-Founder and Vice President of Kids Programs</b><br />
            Max started KidsEcoClub at the age of ten.  He is now thirteen.  He is the recipient of the 2013 Youth Change-Maker award from the San Diego Unified
            School District Board of Education and a 2012 Earth Award from Earth Works for his work to support healthy students, healthy communities and a healthy
            planet.  Max is also an Ambassador to the San Diego Foundation’s 50-year strategic plan for the region and was recognized as an “Outstanding Ambassador
            for Civic Youth Engagement." He is an activist, starting a Change.org petition to President Obama to ban the sale and distribution of shark fin products
            in the United States. The petition garnered support from the Birch Aquarium, Wild Aid, Deep Sea News and the Center for Marine Biodiversity and
            Conservation at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. His vision of a sustainable world is one in which our planet is clean and safe, with enough
            food, water and space for everyone, including animals and fish. His hobbies include collecting animal skulls from his many hikes in the Rocky Mountains.
            This interest was sparked by the discovery of a beaver skull on the roof of his home in Colorado. The beaver was carried there and eaten by a Great
            Horned Owl. Max especially loves owls and started a successful collaboration with the wood shop at Clairemont High in San Diego to build barn owl
            nesting boxes, which are given to public schools to raise awareness about owls. Max frequently speaks to students about the dangers of using poisons
            to control the rodent population due to the secondary kill rates among owls, hawks, foxes, coyotes and other animals. He wants you to know that a pair
            of nesting owls kills 2,000 rodents per year! In addition, Max is a club basketball player, fair golfer, snowboarder, surfer, birder and avid fisherman.
            He enjoys all things outdoors.

            <b>Gavin - Assistant Youth Director</b><br />
            Gavin is six years old and is the inspiration for developing EcoClubs in lower schools.  His vision of a fun environmental club includes frequent fieldtrips to the
            tide pools for exploration.  He has requested that KidsEcoClub support owl nesting boxes, gardens and nearby nature walks at school.  He loves to hike and look for
            animal tracks and wild animals.   He has a very good eye and usually spots animals before the rest of his family.  He has seen numerous deer, elk, bison, cranes,
            osprey, owls, foxes, coyotes, beavers, muskrats and one porcupine.  His vision is of a wide open world with lots of open space to explore.

                            Arts and Letters, and Anthropology programs and departments since 1999. She received her undergraduate training at University of Michigan and her graduate school
                            education at University of California-Davis and then taught at University College London. She conducted post-doctoral research at the University of Giessen in

                            Dr. Parish has been studying the world’s captive population of bonobos for the last twenty years. The bonobo, whose name derives from the ancient Batu word
                            for ancestor, is one of the two species comprising the chimpanzee genus. Bonobos and chimpanzees are the two closest living relatives of humans living today.

                            In 2008, she received a Mellon Award for excellence in faculty mentoring of undergraduate students. Dr. Parish teaches with the goal of helping students to
                            internalize learning enough to pursue it in the future in their own ways. She wants active learners to emerge—students who make sense of the world through
                            their own eyes, experiences, and values, so that they might be significantly enriched by their educational experiences. She also hopes to engage the students
                            in activist pursuits that might lead to more community involvement in their post-campus lives. Dr. Parish is Co-Founder of WorldWideVisionaries.org, an online
                            forum for young people to develop and exchange ideas about working on social justice and environmental causes.
